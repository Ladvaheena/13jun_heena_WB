        &#8614 CSS Opacity property used to set opacity or transparency of whole element including background-color or text.<br>
        &#8614 If we want to apply particular only one element,we can also set that,just apply to the particular content tag.<br>
        &#8614 It is apply by <span>Fliter property</span> and set the value.<br>
        &#8614 The value can be set <span>either in number or percent.</span><br>
        &#8614 In number value set between 0-1; 0 number shows fully transparent and 1 number shows original element.<br>
        &#8614 In percent value set between 0% to 100%; 0% number shows fully transparent and 100% shows original element.<br>
