   <h2>What is the function of the delete operator?</h2> 
   <u>Answer</u>:<br>
   <div class="detail">
    <h4>* Delete operator</h4>
    -> delete operator used to remove/delete property from an object.<br>
    -> On deletation of property,it will return true,if property does not remove/detele it will return false.<br>
    -> If we will try to delete undeclared property , it will also return the true value.<br>
    ->Syntax: delete object.property <br>
    ->One example of it given here,<br>
    <pre>
    &lt;script&gt;
    let Employee = {
        firstname: 'Pooja',
        lastname: 'Sharma',
      };
      console.log(Employee.firstname);
      return output: "John"
    //now,delete the firstname..
      delete Employee.firstname;
      console.log(Employee.firstname);
      return output: undefined------ because,now firstname property will be deleted.
    &lt;/script&gt;
